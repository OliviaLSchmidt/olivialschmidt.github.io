                    <p> My involvement in this project stemmed from a recently developed interest in cars; I had began exploring avenues to apply my newfound occupation, and along the way I discovered that we have a Formula Society of Automotive Engineers (FSAE) club at USF. FSAE is an international engineering design competition that challenges students to imagine, design, and construct a small, formula-style vehicle to compete with other university students. </p>
                    <p> I reached out to the president of the USF FSAE club and conceived of a collaboration between them and my team at USF Esports; racing and competitive gaming were brought together through F1's racing simulation game - F1 2020. After logistics were arranged and a space was prepared with desktop computers and controllers, we had a turnout of about 30 students show up to compete in an in-person tournament on campus. I personally developed and implemented event plans while closely coordinating with my supervisors and the Recreation & Wellness department, while at the same time meeting with our marketing team to review event details and create promotional material for the tournament. </p>
                    <p> The tournament was set to be streamed, so I also helped edit and helped shoot a recruitment/promotional video for Bulls Racing - our FSAE club. During the event, I provided on-site support with participants and managed set-up/organization. </p>
